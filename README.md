# Multi Sensor Data Logger 
## About 
A second year university project using an Arduino board to develop a portable multi sensor data logger with a touchscreen interface to investigate sensor characteristics. The system has two modes the first mode prints live sensory data to the LCD screen and the second creates a file system based on the date and time (provided by the clock module) and logs the data to a file.
